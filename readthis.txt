After a fairly large number of emails I've started working on my type-ahead, predictive text editor project. In support of this effort I'm looking at different algorithms to best predict the word the user next wants to type. The first part of this is looking at documents I've written in the past, and analyzing the frequency of word occurrences within those documents. (I'll skip the details of my theory here, but it involves looking at how often we re-type words compared to how often we use new dictionary-based words beginning with the same characters.)

I wrote a little Ruby program to help me analyze this word frequency. The program opens a file, then adds each word in the file to a hash, where they word is the key and the number of occurrences of the word is the value. At the end of the program I print out the hash information, with the printout sorted in order by the hash value.
